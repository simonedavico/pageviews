# Goal

Business wants to understand better how customers use our platform and analyze their behaviour. As a Liveview evangelist, you told them we could do this natively and don't need any 3rd party services.

Now, you have to prove it! üòÆ‚Äçüí®

## Procedure

Please read the following challenge carefully. It's up to you to decide how much time to invest in this task. To come up with a complete solution, I do expect that you would need around four to six hours. But it depends on a lot, if your first approach will work ‚Äì or if you invest time to improve on it.

It's up to you to make business happy. We are looking for somebody who can solve and develop the scope of a task himself. Be attentive, be creative, be resourceful.

Please provide us at the end with git repo to study your solution.

The conversation after the challenge is as meaningful as the code. We would like to hear how you tried to solve the problem, what you have learned, and where you failed.

### Setup

- Generate a new repo with Phoenix 1.7 and Liveview 0.18
- Setup Phoenix

### Pages

- Create 3 LiveView Controller (Pages), of which the last one (Page C) consists of two tabs.

1. Page A
   Route: /page_a
   Title: "Page A"
   Content: Links to Page B and Page C, Tab 1
2. Page B
   Route: /page_b
   Title: "Page B"
   Content: Links to Page A and Page C, Tab 2
3. Page C (Tabs)
   Routes: /page_c, /page_c/tab_1 and /page_c/tab_2.
   Title: "Page C, Tab 1" or "Page C, Tab 2"
   Content:
   Two Tabs (Tab 1 and Tab 2) realized as LiveComponent (!)
   Tab 1 has a link to Page B, Tab 2 has a link to Page A.

You should be able to switch between the tabs.
Switching between Tabs, changes the URL.

Route /page_c should randomly forward to one tab.
Route /page_c/tab_1 shows Tab 1
Route /page_c/tab_b shows Tab 2

## Task

We want to track session (aka Browser Session) and pageviews without it having a performance penalty on the user request.

### Session

For every new visitor, you create a session and store details in the database in the table tracking_session with the following fields. Create a long-lasting cookie with a unique id to track the same client over multiple sessions.

* Browser Agent
* Unique ID from your cookie
* Pageview

Now, we want to track user engagement. We store for every pageview the following data.

* Session ID
* Phoenix.LiveView.Socket.View (Module Name as String)
* Additional Identify Information
* Engagement Time

### What is a pageview?

Viewing Page A or Page B` triggers a pageview.
Viewing Tab 1 or Tab 2 on Page C triggers a pageview.
What is the engagement_time
We are interested in how much time is spent on a page to understand the behaviour better.

Track how many seconds the page content may be at least partially visible. This means that the page is in a foreground tab of a non-minimized window.
